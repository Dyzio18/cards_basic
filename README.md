# cards_basic
Starting point for other cards projects. I'm use JavaScript and native HTML5 (Drag &amp; Drop)

It's simple game something like "pasjans", but we have to collect points by hitting the same cards. 
I used native JavaScript (without JQuery) to build app logic.

TODO:
- Difficulty levels
- More animations
- Ranking

- (!) Mobile users solution (Users with touch screen can't use  & Drop HTML5 API)
