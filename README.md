# cards_basic
Starting point for other cards projects. I used JavaScript (without JQuery) to build app logic and native HTML5 API (Drag &amp; Drop)

It's simple game something like "pasjans", but we have to collect points by hitting the same cards. 


LIVE DEMO:

TODO:
- Difficulty levels
- More animations
- Ranking

- (!) Mobile users solution (Users with touch screen can't use  & Drop HTML5 API)
